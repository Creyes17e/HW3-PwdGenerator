Bootcamp: HW3-PwdGenerator

Live Site: https://creyes17e.github.io/HW3-PwdGenerator/

Description: Created a password generator using restrictions such as password length 8-128, special characters, numbers, lowercase, and uppercase letters. The generator will walk you through prompts and questions after clicking the button "generate password". Once you have chosen the type of characters for your password, the generator will display it on the "your secure password" box.

Installation: Created a repo in github with a README.md. Through gitbash I cloned the repo I pulled and pushed the origin master to add pages and folders in github. I added and committed meaningful changes and updated the html, css, and js code.
